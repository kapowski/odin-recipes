        <h3>Banh Mi</h3>
        <p>For as long as I have lived in Vancouver the banh mi sandwich has been my go to cheap convenient food and its mix of pickled veggies, meat, pate and spicy peppers has cemented itself as my favourite sandwich. Due to its affordability (and my proximity to an excellent banh mi spot) I have never tried this recipe, and likely never will. However, for those of you in the unfortunate position of not living within 3 blocks of a place that serves banh mi this recipe looks legit.</p>
